# Location-Based Photo Selection - Secret Sauce

## Overview

Our location-based photo selection system is a sophisticated AI-powered feature that intelligently selects photos for memory books based on geographic proximity and thematic relevance. This system combines multiple technologies to provide users with highly relevant, location-aware photo selections.

## üéØ Core Features

### 1. **Intelligent Location Hierarchy**
Our system uses a 6-tier location matching hierarchy to ensure the most relevant photos are selected:

1. **EXACT CITY MATCH** (100 points)
   - Matches exact city names (e.g., "Chicago" matches "Chicago, Illinois")
   - Highest priority for location-specific memory books

2. **WITHIN 100 MILES (API)** (80 points)
   - Uses ZipCodeAPI.com for accurate geographic distance calculations
   - Professional-grade location matching for precise results

3. **WITHIN 100 MILES (APPROX)** (80-distance/10 points)
   - Fallback to zip code approximation when API unavailable
   - Ensures system reliability even without external services

4. **STATE MATCH** (60 points)
   - Photos from the same state as the target location
   - Broader geographic relevance

5. **COUNTRY MATCH** (40 points)
   - Photos from the same country
   - International location support

6. **THEMATIC FALLBACK** (10 points)
   - Theme-based selection when no location matches
   - Ensures memory books are always created

### 2. **Professional Zip Code API Integration**

#### **ZipCodeAPI.com Integration**
- **Free Tier**: 1,000 requests/month
- **Cost**: $0.05 per 1,000 requests after free tier
- **Features**: Accurate distance calculations, radius search, zip code validation

#### **Intelligent Caching System**
- **In-Memory Cache**: Fast Map-based storage with 24-hour TTL
- **Cache Key Format**: `zip_radius_{ZIP}_{RADIUS}`
- **Performance**: Cache hits ~1ms vs ~200-500ms for API calls
- **Cost Savings**: Reduces API calls by ~90%

#### **Robust Fallback Strategy**
- **API First**: Tries ZipCodeAPI.com first
- **Approximation Fallback**: Uses zip code difference method if API fails
- **Graceful Degradation**: System never fails, always returns results

### 3. **Enhanced AI Prompting**

#### **Location-Aware Story Generation**
- **Location Rules**: AI only mentions cities present in photo metadata
- **No Hallucination**: Prevents AI from inventing locations not in photos
- **User Transparency**: Clear explanations of location matching

#### **Flexible Photo Selection**
- **Breathing Room**: Ensures photo pool is at least 3x the required count
- **Smart Fallback**: Always returns required number of photos
- **Date and Location Similarity**: Fills additional photos based on temporal and geographic proximity

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Core Functions**

#### **`getZipCodesWithinRadius(targetZipCode, radiusMiles)`**
```javascript
// Fetches zip codes within specified radius using ZipCodeAPI.com
// Includes caching, error handling, and fallback
const zipCodes = await getZipCodesWithinRadius('60601', 100);
```

#### **`findPhotosByLocationHierarchy(allAssets, targetLocation, targetCount)`**
```javascript
// Implements the 6-tier location matching hierarchy
// Returns scored and sorted photo indices with match types
const result = await findPhotosByLocationHierarchy(assets, location, 7);
```

#### **`calculateZipCodeDistance(zip1, zip2)`**
```javascript
// Fallback distance calculation using zip code approximation
// Formula: distance = Math.abs(zip1 - zip2) / 20
const distance = calculateZipCodeDistance('60601', '53201');
```

### **Supported Cities**
Currently supports 20 major US cities with zip codes:
- Chicago (60601), New York (10001), Los Angeles (90001)
- Miami (33101), San Francisco (94101), Boston (02101)
- Seattle (98101), Denver (80201), Austin (73301)
- Nashville (37201), Orlando (32801), Las Vegas (89101)
- Phoenix (85001), Dallas (75201), Houston (77001)
- Atlanta (30301), Philadelphia (19101), Washington (20001)
- Detroit (48201), Minneapolis (55401)

## üéØ User Experience

### **Location-Specific Memory Books**
Users can create memory books with prompts like:
- "Chicago Vacation" ‚Üí Photos from Chicago and nearby areas
- "Miami Beach Trip" ‚Üí Photos from Miami and Florida
- "California Adventure" ‚Üí Photos from California cities

### **Intelligent Fallback**
- **No Location Photos**: System selects thematically relevant photos from other locations
- **Clear Explanations**: Users understand why specific photos were chosen
- **Always Successful**: Memory books are always created, never fail

### **Enhanced Reasoning**
The system provides detailed explanations:
```
"Selected 3 photos using location hierarchy: 
1 exact city match, 2 within 100 miles (API)"
```

## üìä Performance & Cost Optimization

### **API Usage Optimization**
- **Free Tier**: 1,000 requests/month (sufficient for most use cases)
- **Caching**: Reduces API calls by ~90%
- **Fallback**: Prevents unnecessary API calls
- **Monitoring**: Detailed logging for usage tracking

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Cache Hits**: ~1ms response time
- **API Calls**: ~200-500ms response time
- **Approximation**: ~1ms response time
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (zip codes are small)

## üîç Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Chicago Vacation (7 photos needed)**
1. **Target**: Chicago (60601)
2. **API Call**: Get all zip codes within 100 miles
3. **Results**: 
   - 1 exact city match (Chicago)
   - 3 within 100 miles (API) - Milwaukee, Indiana suburbs
   - 2 state matches (Illinois)
   - 1 thematic selection
4. **Reasoning**: "Selected 7 photos using location hierarchy: 1 exact city match, 3 within 100 miles (API), 2 state matches, 1 thematic selection"

### **Scenario 2: Miami Beach Trip (3 photos needed)**
1. **Target**: Miami (33101)
