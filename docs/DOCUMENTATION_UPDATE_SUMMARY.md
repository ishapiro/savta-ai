**New Content:**
```markdown
#### `MEMORY_BOOKS_PAGE_FLOW.md`
- **Purpose**: Detailed technical documentation of the memory-books page architecture
- **Content**: Complex component interactions, reactive state management, event flows, and API integration
- **Audience**: Developers working on the memory-books page implementation
```

### 2. `docs/MEMORY_BOOK_FEATURES.md`
**Changes Made:**
- Updated Memory Book Management section to reflect current implementation
- Added new features: AI Photo Selection, Progress Dialog, Grid/List Views
