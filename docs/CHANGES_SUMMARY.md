   - Added fetching of face and person group data
   - Built asset-to-people mapping
   - Attached people data to asset objects

2. **`server/utils/openai-client.js`** (lines 1061-1091, 1127-1200)
   - Enhanced asset data formatting to include people information
   - Updated AI prompt with PEOPLE MATCH as #1 priority
   - Added new PEOPLE PRIORITY RULES section
   - Updated photo display format in prompt

3. **`docs/PHOTO_SELECTION_PEOPLE_ENHANCEMENT.md`** (new file)
   - Comprehensive documentation of the enhancement
   - Usage examples
   - Technical implementation details
   - Testing recommendations

### Technical Details

#### Data Flow
```
Database (person_groups, faces, face_person_links)
    ↓
magic-memory.post.js (fetches & maps people data)
    ↓
assets + people information
    ↓
openai-client.js (formats for AI)
    ↓
Enhanced AI Prompt with people context
    ↓
GPT-4o selects photos matching people names/relationships
```

#### Format Example

**Before:**
```
- People: Sarah, Michael
- Tags: family, birthday, indoor
```

**After:**
```
- Identified People: Sarah (Mom), Michael (Dad), Ben (Uncle Benjamin)
- Tags: family, birthday, indoor
```

### Key Features

✅ **Fetches person metadata**: Full name, display name, relationship  
✅ **AI Priority #1**: People matching now comes first in selection priority  
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Falls back gracefully if no people data exists  
✅ **Supports Multiple Names**: Handles both full names and display names  
✅ **Relationship Context**: AI understands relationships when selecting  
✅ **Token Efficient**: Concise formatting fits within API limits  

### User Benefits

Users can now create prompts like:
- "Show me photos with Grandma Sarah"
- "I want cards of Uncle Tom"
- "Chicago trip with Michael and the kids"
- "Early photos of my family"

The AI will intelligently prioritize photos containing the mentioned people while also considering location, date, and thematic context.

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test basic person name matching: "Show photos of Sarah"
- [ ] Test relationship matching: "Show Grandmother photos"
- [ ] Test mixed criteria: "Chicago visit with Uncle Tom"
- [ ] Test full name vs display name: "Benjamin / Ben"
- [ ] Test fallback: Prompts without people mentioned still work
- [ ] Test edge cases: People with only one type of name, no relationships
- [ ] Verify token usage stays within limits
- [ ] Check PDF generation still works with enhanced data

### Linting Status

✅ No errors in modified files
✅ Code follows project conventions
✅ Backward compatible implementation

### Documentation

Full documentation available in:
- `docs/PHOTO_SELECTION_PEOPLE_ENHANCEMENT.md` - Complete technical guide
- `docs/architecture.mermaid` - System architecture (no changes needed)

### Notes

- The enhancement gracefully degrades if face recognition data is unavailable
- Falls back to `asset.user_people` if enhanced people data is not present
- Compatible with existing location-based and thematic matching
- No database schema changes required
- All existing functionality preserved
