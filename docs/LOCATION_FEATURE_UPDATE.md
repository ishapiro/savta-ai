# Location Feature Update

This update adds AI-powered GPS location detection to photos, storing city, state, country, and ZIP code information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
- Added `location`, `city`, `state`, `country`, and `zip_code` fields to the `assets` table
- Added indexes for efficient location queries
- Created migration file: `supabase/migration_add_location_fields.sql`

### 2. AI-Powered Upload Enhancement
- Modified `server/api/ai/process-asset.post.js` to extract GPS data from EXIF metadata
- **Replaced MapBox geocoding** with AI-powered location determination using OpenAI's GPT-4o
- Automatically populates location fields during upload with intelligent location detection

### 3. Review Page Enhancement
- Updated `pages/app/review.vue` to display location information
- Added location chips showing city, state, and country
- Color-coded chips for easy identification

### 4. AI Processing Integration
- Location detection is now part of the comprehensive AI processing pipeline
- Uses pre-extracted EXIF data for accurate GPS coordinate analysis
- Provides intelligent location context and landmark identification

## Installation Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```sql
-- Run the migration in your Supabase SQL editor
-- File: supabase/migration_add_location_fields.sql
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
The system now uses AI for location detection, so no external geocoding API tokens are required:

```bash
# OpenAI API Key for AI-powered location detection
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 3. Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Features

### GPS Extraction
- Extracts GPS coordinates from photo EXIF metadata using the `exifr` library
- Works with photos taken on GPS-enabled devices
- Handles various EXIF formats

### AI-Powered Location Detection
- **Replaced MapBox geocoding** with AI-based location determination
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to convert GPS coordinates to human-readable locations
- Provides city, state, country, and landmark information
- More accurate and context-aware than traditional geocoding

### Location Display
- Shows location information on review page
- Color-coded chips for different location components
- Only displays when location data is available

## Technical Details

### Database Fields
```sql
location text        -- Human-readable location (e.g., "Evanston, Illinois, United States")
city text           -- City name
state text          -- State/province name
country text        -- Country name
zip_code text       -- Postal/ZIP code
```

### AI Integration
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model for intelligent location determination
- Converts GPS coordinates to human-readable location names
- Provides context-aware location information
- Handles edge cases and provides fallback options

### EXIF Processing
- Uses the `exifr` library for comprehensive EXIF parsing
- Extracts GPS coordinates, date/time, camera information
- Pre-processes data before sending to AI for analysis

## Benefits

1. **More Accurate**: AI provides context-aware location detection
2. **Intelligent**: Understands landmarks and points of interest
3. **Cost Effective**: No additional API costs for geocoding
4. **Simplified**: Single AI processing pipeline for all metadata
5. **Privacy Conscious**: Only processes photos with GPS data

## Migration from MapBox

### What Changed
- **Removed**: MapBox geocoding API integration
- **Removed**: `scripts/update-photo-locations.js` (no longer needed)
- **Removed**: `/api/analyze-image` endpoint (replaced by AI processing)
- **Added**: AI-powered location detection in `process-asset.post.js`

### Benefits of Migration
1. **Better Accuracy**: AI understands context better than simple coordinate lookup
2. **Cost Reduction**: No MapBox API costs
3. **Simplified Architecture**: Single processing pipeline
4. **Enhanced Features**: AI can identify landmarks and provide richer context

## Testing

1. Upload photos with GPS data and verify AI location detection
2. Check review page for location chips
3. Test with photos without GPS data (should handle gracefully)
4. Verify AI processing integration and accuracy

## Future Enhancements

- Location-based photo filtering
- Map view of photo locations
- Location-based memory book themes
- Travel timeline features
- AI-powered landmark recognition
- Smart location suggestions
