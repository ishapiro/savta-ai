# Mobile PDF Fullscreen Fix

## Overview

Fixed the PDF viewer on mobile devices to fill the full screen and prevent unwanted movement when users try to pan and drag. The issue was that the PDF viewer had padding and margins that created "dead zones" where users could accidentally touch, causing unwanted scrolling or movement.

## Problem

On mobile devices, the PDF viewer had several issues:

1. **Padding and Margins**: The container had `pb-20` (padding-bottom: 5rem) and `mb-4` (margin-bottom: 1rem) that created space around the content
2. **Dead Zones**: Areas outside the pan container could be accidentally touched, causing unwanted movement
3. **Not Full Screen**: The viewer didn't truly fill the entire viewport on mobile
4. **Touch Event Issues**: Default touch behaviors weren't properly prevented

## Solution

### 1. **Mobile Detection**
- Enhanced mobile detection using user agent string
- Applied mobile-specific styles only when on mobile devices

### 2. **Full Screen Container**
```vue
<div class="relative w-full h-full bg-brand-navigation" :class="{ 'mobile-fullscreen': isMobile }">
```

### 3. **Conditional Padding/Margins**
```vue
<div class="w-full h-full overflow-hidden scrollbar-hide" :class="{ 'pb-20': !isMobile }">
```

### 4. **Mobile Fullscreen CSS**
```css
.mobile-fullscreen {
  position: fixed !important;
  top: 0 !important;
  left: 0 !important;
  right: 0 !important;
  bottom: 0 !important;
  width: 100vw !important;
  height: 100vh !important;
  z-index: 9999 !important;
  margin: 0 !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
  border-radius: 0 !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
}
```

### 5. **Mobile Pan Container**
```css
.mobile-pan-container {
  width: 100vw !important;
  height: 100vh !important;
  margin: 0 !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
  touch-action: none !important;
  -webkit-touch-callout: none !important;
  -webkit-user-select: none !important;
  user-select: none !important;
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent !important;
}
```

### 6. **Enhanced Touch Event Handling**
```javascript
// Prevent default behavior to avoid unwanted scrolling/movement
event.preventDefault()
event.stopPropagation()
```

## Key Features

### **Full Screen Coverage**
- PDF viewer now fills the entire viewport on mobile
- No padding or margins that could create dead zones
- Fixed positioning ensures complete screen coverage

### **Touch Event Prevention**
- `touch-action: none` prevents default touch behaviors
- `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` on all touch events
- `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent` removes tap highlights

### **Responsive Design**
- Desktop behavior unchanged
- Mobile-specific optimizations only applied on mobile devices
- Conditional CSS classes based on device detection

### **Pan Container Optimization**
- Pan container fills entire screen on mobile
- No accidental touches outside the pan area
- Proper bounds calculation for panning

## Implementation Details

### **Template Changes**
1. Added conditional `mobile-fullscreen` class to main container
2. Removed padding-bottom on mobile for document container
3. Removed margin-bottom on mobile for image/PDF containers
4. Added `mobile-pan-container` class to pan container
5. Added `touchcancel` event handler

### **CSS Enhancements**
1. **Mobile Fullscreen**: Fixed positioning with full viewport coverage
2. **Touch Prevention**: Comprehensive touch event prevention
3. **Visual Cleanup**: Removed tap highlights and user selection
4. **Overflow Control**: Hidden overflow to prevent scrolling

### **JavaScript Improvements**
1. **Enhanced Event Handling**: Better touch event prevention
2. **Mobile Detection**: Improved mobile device detection
3. **Panning Logic**: Better bounds calculation for mobile
4. **Debug Logging**: Added mobile context to debug logs
