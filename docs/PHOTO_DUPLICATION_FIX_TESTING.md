# Photo Duplication Fix - Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing procedures to verify that the photo duplication fixes work correctly across all photo selection flows.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Frontend: Manual Photo Selection Toggle** (`composables/usePhotoSelection.js`)
- **Function**: `photoSelection_toggleMemorySelection()`
- **Fix**: Added deduplication check when adding photos
- **Behavior**: When a user tries to select the same photo twice, the second selection will toggle it off (deselect) instead of adding a duplicate
- **Test Signal**: UI should show the photo as unselected on second click

### 2. **Backend: Manual Photo Selection Deduplication** (`server/api/ai/magic-memory.post.js`)
- **Method**: `photo_library` mode
- **Fix**: Deduplicates the `photo_selection_pool` before fetching assets from database
- **Test Signal**: Console should show "Duplicate photos detected in selection pool: X duplicates removed"

### 3. **Backend: AI Photo Selection Deduplication** (`server/utils/openai-client.js`)
- **Function**: `selectPhotosByAttributes()`
- **Fix**: Removes duplicate indices from AI's selection before returning
- **Test Signal**: Console should show "DUPLICATE INDICES DETECTED" if duplicates are found

### 4. **Backend: Final Safety Check** (`server/api/ai/magic-memory.post.js`)
- **Location**: Before saving to database
- **Fix**: Final deduplication pass ensures no duplicates reach the database
- **Test Signal**: Console should show "FINAL SAFETY CHECK: Duplicate asset IDs detected before save"

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Manual Photo Selection - Preventing Frontend Duplicates

**Setup**:
1. Go to `/app/memory-books`
2. Click "Create Memory Card"
3. Select "Photo library" option
4. Click "Next" to open photo selection dialog

**Test Steps**:
1. Click on a photo to select it (should highlight/show as selected)
2. Click on the same photo again (should deselect it/toggle off)
3. Verify the UI reflects the deselection
4. Manually select 3 photos
5. Click "Create Memory Card"

**Expected Result**: 
- No duplicate photos in the created card
- Console should NOT show "Duplicate photos detected" (because frontend prevents it)
- Card displays exactly 3 unique photos

**Database Verification**:
```sql
SELECT id, title, array_length(created_from_assets, 1) as photo_count,
       array_length(array(SELECT DISTINCT unnest(created_from_assets)), 1) as unique_count
FROM memory_books
WHERE id = '<created_card_id>'
```
Should show: `photo_count = unique_count = 3`

---

### Test 2: Manual Photo Selection - Backend Deduplication Fallback

**Setup**:
1. Bypass frontend and directly test backend API
2. Open browser DevTools Network tab

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a memory book with manual photos (Test 1)
2. Edit the memory book
3. In DevTools, modify the `photo_selection_pool` to contain duplicates before sending
4. OR manually craft an API request with duplicate photo IDs in `photo_selection_pool`

**Expected Result**:
- Backend deduplicates automatically
- Console shows: "Duplicate photos detected in selection pool: X duplicates removed"
- Final `created_from_assets` has only unique photos

**Console Signals**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate photos detected in selection pool: 5 duplicates removed
üì∏ Original count: 8, Unique count: 3
```

---

### Test 3: AI Photo Selection - New Card Creation

**Setup**:
1. Go to `/app/memory-books`
2. Click "Create Memory Card"
3. Select "I'll choose for you" (AI selection)
4. Fill in the prompt and configure settings
5. Click "Create Memory Card"

**Expected Result**:
- AI selects photos without duplicates
- If AI accidentally selected same photo twice, `selectPhotosByAttributes()` catches it
- Console should show: `‚úÖ Selected photos: [indices]` (all unique)
- NO console warning about duplicates (normal case)

**Abnormal Case** (If AI returns duplicates):
- Console shows: `‚ö†Ô∏è DUPLICATE INDICES DETECTED: X -> Y (Z duplicates removed)`
- Remaining photos are filled from available pool to reach target count
- Card is created successfully with unique photos

---

### Test 4: AI Photo Selection - Edit Card with AI

**Setup**:
1. Create a card with AI selection (Test 3)
2. Click the three-dots menu on the card
3. Select "Regenerate with AI"
4. Change the prompt and settings
5. Click "Generate"

**Expected Result**:
- New photos are selected using AI
- No duplicates in final result
- Console shows deduplication if any occurred

---

### Test 5: AI Complementary Selection - When Deduplication Leaves Too Few Photos

**Setup**: Create a scenario where AI selection would result in duplicates

**Advanced Test Steps**:
1. Create a memory card that needs 4 photos
2. Manually set up a test case where AI would select: [0, 1, 2, 1] (duplicate of index 1)
3. Or use a small photo pool where duplicates are likely

**Expected Result**:
- Deduplication detects the duplicate: `4 -> 3` (lost 1 photo)
- System recognizes we have only 3 but need 4
- Console shows: `üéØ Deduplication left us short: have 3, need 4 (need 1 more)`
- AI is called to select complementary photos:
  ```
  üéØ Asking AI to select 1 complementary photo(s) from X available...
  üéØ Making AI request for complementary photos...
  ```
- Final result has exactly 4 unique photos
- Reasoning includes: `AI then selected 1 complementary photo(s) to reach required 4`

**Console Signals** (When Complementary Selection Occurs):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è DUPLICATE INDICES DETECTED: 4 -> 3 (1 duplicates removed)
‚ö†Ô∏è Original indices: [0, 1, 2, 1]
‚ö†Ô∏è Unique indices: [0, 1, 2]
üéØ Deduplication left us short: have 3, need 4 (need 1 more)
üéØ 3 unselected photos available to choose from
üéØ Asking AI to select 1 complementary photo(s) from 3 available...
üéØ Making AI request for complementary photos...
üéØ AI selected 1 complementary photos
üéØ Complementary reasoning: This photo complements the existing selection by...
```

**Database Verification**:
```sql
SELECT id, title, array_length(created_from_assets, 1) as photo_count,
       array_length(array(SELECT DISTINCT unnest(created_from_assets)), 1) as unique_count
FROM memory_books
WHERE id = '<card_id>'
```
Should show: `photo_count = unique_count = 4`

### Test 5: Photo Replacement - Replacing Some Photos

**Setup**:
1. Create a card with 3 photos (Test 1 or 3)
2. Click the three-dots menu
3. Select "Refine" or "Edit"
4. Choose "Select photos to replace"
5. Mark one or more photos for replacement

**Test Steps**:
1. Mark 1-2 photos for replacement
2. In the photo selection dialog, select replacement photos
3. Ensure replacement photos are different from existing ones
4. Click "Replace"

**Expected Result**:
- The marked photos are replaced
- Replacement photos are NOT duplicates of remaining or other replacement photos
- Final card has all unique photos
- Console shows replacement logic processing

**Console Signals**:
```
üîÑ Photo replacement detected, replacing 1 photo(s)
üîÑ DEBUG - Replacement selection result: {...}
```

---

### Test 6: Photo Replacement - Limited Pool

**Setup**:
1. Create a card with photos from a specific location/date
2. Edit it and mark all photos for replacement
3. The pool of available replacement photos is limited

**Test Steps**:
1. Mark multiple photos for replacement
2. Select from limited replacement pool (few unused photos)
3. Try to create duplicate selections
4. Click "Replace"

**Expected Result**:
- System finds unique replacement photos from available pool
- If insufficient unique photos exist, error message is shown
- OR duplicates are detected and removed, fewer photos used
- No card state corruption

---

### Test 7: Database Validation - Check for Existing Duplicates

**Setup**: Run this SQL query

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT id, user_id, 
       array_length(created_from_assets, 1) as total_photos,
       array_length(array(SELECT DISTINCT unnest(created_from_assets)), 1) as unique_photos,
       created_at
FROM memory_books
WHERE array_length(created_from_assets, 1) != array_length(array(SELECT DISTINCT unnest(created_from_assets)), 1)
AND deleted = false
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Expected Result**:
- Before fix: May show records where `total_photos > unique_photos` (duplicates exist)
- After fix: No records should be returned (all cards have unique photos)

**If Duplicates Found**:
- These are pre-existing duplicates from before the fix
- Can optionally create a cleanup script to fix them

---

### Test 8: Book Creation with Manual Photos

**Setup**:
1. Go to `/app/memory-books`
2. Click "Create Memory Book"
3. Choose "Photo library" selection method
4. Select photos manually

**Test Steps**:
1. Select 4-6 photos for the book
2. Click "Create Book"
3. Verify book has unique photos

**Expected Result**:
- Book is created with only unique photos
- No duplicates in display or database

---

### Test 9: Pagination and Multiple Operations

**Setup**: Test concurrent operations

**Test Steps**:
1. Create 3 cards with different photo selections simultaneously
2. Edit 2 of them at the same time
3. Replace photos in one while creating another
4. Monitor console for race conditions

**Expected Result**:
- All operations complete successfully
- No cross-contamination of photo IDs
- Each card has unique photos

---

### Test 10: Edge Cases

#### 10.1: User Selects Only 1 Photo Twice
- **Setup**: Manual selection with only 1 photo available
- **Test**: Try to select it twice
- **Expected**: Frontend prevents it (toggle off)

#### 10.2: Photo Pool Contains Same ID Multiple Times
- **Setup**: Manually craft request with `photo_selection_pool = [id1, id2, id1, id3]`
- **Test**: Submit to backend
- **Expected**: Backend deduplicates to `[id1, id2, id3]`

#### 10.3: AI Returns Invalid Indices
- **Setup**: Inject test to make AI return `[0, 1, 0, 2]`
- **Test**: Process through `selectPhotosByAttributes`
- **Expected**: Deduplication catches it, returns `[0, 1, 2]`

#### 10.4: Photo Deleted After Selection But Before Save
- **Setup**: Select photo, admin deletes photo, try to save
- **Test**: Complete the flow
- **Expected**: Graceful error about missing photo OR auto-removal of deleted photo ID

## Monitoring After Deployment

Post-deployment, monitor:

1. **Console Logs**: Watch for deduplication warnings
2. **User Reports**: Check for duplicate photo issues
3. **Performance**: Monitor response times
4. **Error Rates**: Track for new error patterns

Query to monitor:
```sql
-- Check for any new duplicate photos created
SELECT COUNT(*) as duplicate_books
FROM memory_books
WHERE array_length(created_from_assets, 1) != array_length(array(SELECT DISTINCT unnest(created_from_assets)), 1)
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
AND deleted = false;
```

If this ever returns > 0, a regression has occurred.
